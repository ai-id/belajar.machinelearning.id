# New Way

There are many approaches to machine learning, one of the popular ones is through material books and videos, but in this repository I will try to use an approach based on coding practice, does not require a lot of mathematical notation, only the use of package libraries available on the internet, the focus is on understanding machine learning in general but more practical coding.

In this repository I will not include deep learning (tensorflow) and others such as natural language processing (NLTK, Stanford NLP, etc.) or computer vision (OpenCV), only focusing on traditional machine learning more generally.

Topic: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Model Selection and Evaluation, Dataset Tranformation, API, Visualization, Case Study: Implementing in Webapps.
